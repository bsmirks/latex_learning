\section*{Objective}
Over the course of the last several years, I have grown beyond proficiency with respect to both infrastructure engineering and DevOps practices. 
My journey began in IT operations support and is currently systems engineering. 
I have embraced systems administration, configuration management, and provisioning pipelines. 
Over the next few years I look forward to continuing my journey deeper into DevOps engineering focused on configuration management and provisioning practices. 
My ideal employer will foster growth, both personally and professionally by challenging me with opportunities to engineer new and improved solutions.
